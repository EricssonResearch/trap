/**
 * A collection of compatibility utilities. These utilities range from simple
 * functions missing from the Java core libraries, to classes implemented for
 * compatibility with older instances of Java. These utilities are designed to
 * always use the most-recent-implementation, so if functionality is available
 * in the current JVM, it will be preferred (by using the appropriate .jar).
