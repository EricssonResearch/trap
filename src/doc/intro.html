	TrAP; the Transport Abstraction Package is a library that provides a
	message-based point-to-point link between two nodes using one or more
	transports, the exact type and implementation of which is abstracted
	away from the application. The main usefulness of such an abstraction
	level is that the application does not need to concern itself with
	managing different transports, types, keepalives and protocols, but can
	use an existing and tested codebase for it.
	<p>TrAP provides a number of features to ease development of
		applications, while keeping maximum flexibility:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Automatic Transport Detection</b>: TrAP will automatically
			discover all potential transports, and select and use the most
			applicable transport, based on a user-customisable priority order.
		<li><b>Transport Handover</b>: TrAP can seamlessly hand over
			between different transport types. It can use a common transport
			(such as HTTP) to perform initial connection, while it discovers
			others. The connection is <i>fully usable</i> while TrAP performs its
			work!
		<li><b>Transport Recovery</b>: If a transport fails for any
			reason (network change, handover from mobile network to wifi), TrAP
			can fall back to a common transport and reconnect. While connectivity
			is briefly interrupted, no messages are lost.
		<li><b>Liveness Checking &amp; Configuration</b>: The liveness status
			of a TrAP connection can be inspected and changed at runtime. Fully
			customisable keepalives means that applications can have infrequent
			ones (for long lived connections) and frequent ones (when response
			time is critical).
		<li><b>Configurable Message Processing</b>: TrAP can operate in
			synchronous and asynchronous modes, and allows full control over both
			incoming and outgoing message buffers. Memory footprint and message
			throughput can thus be tweaked depending on the application.
		<li><b>Cross-Language</b>: TrAP supports Java, JavaScript, C++
			and Objective-C, and goes as low as 32kb per connection (using a
			linked message buffer, and only one live transport at a time).
	</ul>
	<p>Trap works on a client/server model, and the high level API is
		generally based on sockets (albeit message-based, and not streaming).
		A server opens up a Trap Endpoint for "listening". The client connects
		to the server; by doing so, a new Endpoint object is generated on the
		server to hold the other end of the connection. The pair of endpoints
		can then communicate freely.
