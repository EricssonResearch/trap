	 * must not change this collection after this call, and must not assume the
	 * transport will call this function more times than one. It can assume the
	 * transport calls this function at least once.
	 * &lt;p>
	 * As an argument, the transport supplies the context keys available from
	 * this transport. The returned collection may not contain a key that does
	 * not exist in the &lt;i>availableKeys&lt;/i> collection. If the
	 * TrapAuthentication's implementation requires a context value whose key
	 * not exist in &lt;i>availableKeys&lt;/i>, it may generate a value, as long as it
	 * does not significantly compromise the integrity of the authentication.
	 * &lt;p>
	 * If there is not enough context information for this TrapAuthentication
	 * instance to successfully work, it may throw a TrapException.
	 * 
	 * @param availableKeys

	 *            fill in with meaningful values.
