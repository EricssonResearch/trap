Transport Abstraction Package (trap)
====

This library provides a socket-based interface that abstracts a set of underlying transports (socket, websocket, http, functioncall), while allowing reconnects, network connection changes, compression and multiplexing. Trap can utilise one or more underlying connections to improve performance.
